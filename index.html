  <!--Intro -->
  <div class="Intro" id="Intro">
    <h1 class="Introh1">Introduction</h1>
        <p>There are reasons for engaging in this dispute and staying with it, without a script, and allowing facts 
            and truth to evolve:</p>

    <p>The specific reason for my willingness, after The Committee repeatedly asked me to finally come forward
      and tell this story, is to inform my former colleagues and their clients of the plot(s) they were in, but
      didn’t know it. The story is the story. Everything I am showing and telling you is the story.

    <p>Let me now extend to you all the opportunity to ask me to clarify and expand on points contained that may
      need further explanation. There is an allocated spot on the domain at the end to ask a question or make a
      comment. I will answer those questions which are a reflection of an honest attempt to know more.

    <p>The Committee is a collection of people I have interacted with over the years, including colleagues, to
      share with them what was being found by me. Trips to NYC, DC, Tallahassee, and Miami were keys to
      uncovering other people's interests which didn’t include yours.

    <p>So, even with some reticence in choosing to bring this forward, I want to say that I thought I could
      provide a complete remedy with those who are sworn to help protect investors, but I could not. I do hope
      that this will create the interest necessary to “encourage” Morgan Stanley to fully comply with the orders
      they have signed and repair the damage to the financial advisors and their clients.

    <p>You will read in other places, as well, what I am going to tell you now. This scheme, conspiracy, plot or
      whatever you choose to call it, was driven by the fixed income department of the firm initially, then
      legal, then upper management supported the process of keeping the violations from you. No financial
      advisor intentionally or deliberately misrepresented the surplus notes as bonds as they didn’t know they
      were ever surplus notes. Nor were they ever made aware that there were 8 years of bluesky violations
      which, of course, included every sale of the Kemper Lumbermens Surplus Notes.

    <p>Now, if you are interested, follow the story along as I have written and documented it. I have done the
      best I can with an orderly presentation of the facts. The story was never expected to get this far, and
      you will no doubt see periodic grammatical and spelling errors contained in the blog notes and probably
      elsewhere. There will be some repetition from documents included from different time stages, but all that
      being said, I believe it’s all there for your understanding. After all, it’s just me telling the story.

    <!--Responsibilities For Engaging-->

      <h1 class="Twoh1">Responsibility to Engage</h1>
      When you enter into a situation like this, with literally no information, one would have no reason to think that
      it
      was going to be any more difficult than just making a few inquiries and getting some answers. But in this case,
      that
      was different. I do want to tell you that the policy on reporting potential illegal and unethical conduct at
      Morgan
      Stanley states the following: “every employee of the firm is responsible for preserving and protecting Morgan
      Stanley's reputation for integrity and excellence. You're expected to do more than simply follow the applicable
      rules. You are required to escalate promptly potential legal, regulatory, and ethical misconduct”. And that's what
      I
      did.

      I did send a general letter to five people at Morgan Stanley asking for their response to the problem. And I also
      informed the SEC in October of 2004, that there was a situation where I couldn't get my arms around yet, but I
      needed their help. And as far as I can tell, their response was to do nothing until I, with assistance from Donna
      Norman, arranged for an on site meeting with the SEC for about 2 hours in 2009 to allow them to engage. They
      eventually, in an email, responded that this was a state’s issue. Of course, when the states fail to discharge, it
      becomes theirs, pure and simple.</p>

    <!--The NASD/FINRA mediation and examination-->
    <div class="Two" id="TwoA">
      <h1 class="Twoh1">The NASD/FINRA mediation and examination</h1>
      <p>Richard Mittnacht was a client I inherited from Mike Blankenship on January 3, 2003. Rich was determined
        to get to the bottom of the Lumbermens' issues, and he was able to retain a Boca Raton firm as long as we
        had 6 clients willing to be part of the action. It did happen in February of 2005 in mediation initially,
        with me involved. Morgan Stanley was, of course, not forthcoming with real and honest disclosure and the
        legal firm chose to inform the 6 clients that they were no longer going to represent any of the 6 in the
        upcoming arbitrations, scheduled in the next several weeks. In other words, the attorney for us the
        plaintiffs provided an ultimatum of either settle or good luck replacing us in the next 2 weeks to
        continue with the arbitration. So, 1 by 1, each of them entered the Morgan Stanley conference room to hash
        out their settlement while, naturally, I was going to be last.
      <p>When the 5th client disappeared into their chamber, I left and went back to Stuart without notice.
        Remember, I was still employed by MS at the time. I had no interest in any settlement with the firm if I
        didn’t know exactly what the infractions were. They called me and I said I would choose to continue my
        financial advisor duties which I did, but I contacted the NASD with direction and encouragement to conduct
        an examination. I was fortunate to have skilled people listening and acting on the clients interests.
      <p>The examination by the NASD commenced shortly after and was concluded in early May of ‘05. We were able
        to communicate with the lead examiner Gene Davis out of their New Orleans office, and we had appreciated
        his candor during a couple of conversations.
      <p>Mike Blankenship and I were able to speak with him shortly after he concluded his examination. His
        response was this: this examination was the easiest and straightforward examination he had taken part in,
        and it would result in the largest award in the history of the NASD. The time frame for his comment was
        sometime after May of 2005. At that point the waiting game began for over 2 and a quarter years with the
        culmination released on August 2, 2007.


      <p>It was clear after the FINRA news release of fining Morgan Stanley $6.1 million for overcharging in
        customer “ bond sales”, that they had not reflected Gene Davis’s comment to us that this would be an
        unprecedented award. The NASD later, on August 1, 2007 changed its name to FINRA a day before their order
        on Lumbermens.

      <p>One can only deduce that Gene was referring to both the Blue-Sky law violations and the misrepresentation
        of the surplus notes as bonds. I believe I know who stepped in and quashed these findings, but I prefer to
        hold off on his and her identification. Gene Davis, until his superiors prevented us from contacting him,
        was cooperative and accepted our few calls willingly. Gene has the knowledge of how the award he was
        expecting was fully diminished in the FINRA consent order of August 2, 2007 and so does his former boss
        Mitchell Atkins who assisted in arranging the examination in 2005.

      <p>Therefore, you could never inform your clients. You didn't know which securities were involved. I mean,
        it's really an unparalleled breach of fiduciary that the firm had to everyone in the first place. This
        employee, Kenneth Carberry IV, was solely identified, fined and suspended at Morgan Stanley for a short
        time as mentioned in the FINRA order of 8/2/2007. I think we ought to hear from Mr. Carberry, as to what
        role he played in this whole duping of surplus notes pretending to be bonds and unregistered. Morgan
        Stanley fought like a tiger to keep me from being able to depose Carberry in the ongoing arbitration I
        had. And remember, the compliance employees at Morgan Stanley were aware of the Blue Sky violations long
        before they were uncovered by the NASD/FINRA examination out of their New Orleans office which I caused.

      <p>You’ll read shortly in the consent order with the states found by me in late 2008, Morgan Stanley
        admitted to “self informing” on their blue-sky problem in May of 2005, coincidentally at the time of the
        conclusion of Gene’s examination. If they “self informed,” they would have done it without the help of the
        examination I caused years before 2005. I have been blacklisted from any contact with the FINRA agency for
        years now as I asked multiple times, after learning of all the violations, FINRA to go back and revisit
        their findings. Their lawyer I tangled with from DC was Terri Reicher, abrupt, arrogant and disinterested
        in the facts of the matter and the investor’s welfare. You’ll read an exchange with her shortly.</p>

    <h1 class="Threeh1">Contacting the WSJ For their support</h1>
    <p>One of the most fascinating parts of the story was, as we then knew, the FINRA examination was concluded
      about May of 2005. And by the spring of 2006, we hadn't heard of a word from the agency. And the Regional
      Chief Counsel in New Orleans, Andrew A Favret, was not forthcoming in any fashion as to what they did find
      relative to the examination.

    <p>So, three of us were getting together in the spring of 2006, and concluded that we ought to ask the Wall
      Street Journal to make a phone call, inform FINRA that they knew the examination had concluded and ask
      them for an update. And so we did, we called and spoke to reporter Randall Smith, who seemed interested,
      and in fact, wanted to come down to Stuart, to meet with some of the brokers and some of the clients who
      had been disadvantaged.

    <p>He arrived and took as much information as he could, and literally never did a thing except sit on the
      story. So, another year went by, we're now in the summer of 2007. And finally, on August the second 2007,
      FINRA came out with their totally improper findings of the bond overpricing problem. Oh, I agree that it
      was also a pricing problem but, as I would find out later, it was both a sale of an unregistered security
      and misrepresented as a bond and not a surplus note. If you read the monograph above, I have offered the
      definition of both to you. They deliberately solicited the financial advisors to sell a surplus note that
      they called a mutual note on the confirm and statement. They misjudged the ramifications of this surplus
      notes going through the floorboards over the next year. I spoke to Merrill Lynch and UBS about their
      knowledge of these notes and they did not participate in them at all. I believe MS must have been the only
      firm making a market which put them in grave danger over the next year. That's when I got more interested
      in meeting with the states representative and so forth.

    <p>The WSJ sat on the story until 8 months after the FINRA release of August 2, 2007. And unbelievably,
      within a month after informing Randall Smith that I was no longer in the employment of Morgan Stanley, out
      comes the article in the Wall Street Journal on May 24, of 2008, with an interesting caricature of me,
      with a whistle in my mouth, “broker Dana de Windt blew the whistle” and calling me a Morgan Stanley
      Crusader. It was fine I suppose. The article was clever, I guess, but it was brought out 8 months after
      FINRA’s release in August of 2007. And here he's dropping this thing in May of 2008. So I read it and that
      was it.

    <p>Then I got a phone call the next day, one phone call in the United States, a fellow financial advisor in
      Ohio, Wayne Dodds, called me. He said, I just want you to know that I appreciate what you did in trying to
      get to the bottom of this. But I want to tell you that I have clients in Tennessee, and in January of
      2007, they received a rescission opportunity with Morgan Stanley on Kemper lumbermen’s surplus notes
      without ever asking or soliciting. Seriously!!! Well, my short reprieve from chasing Morgan Stanley was
      brief and so on we go.

    <p>There were no actions in Tennessee being taken. So, Morgan Stanley, found it in their best interest to go
      into Tennessee in January of 2007. The FINRA findings didn't even come out until August 2, 2007. You've
      got a seven-month gap, of which Morgan Stanley presumably didn't know what FINRA was coming up with. And
      they wanted to give people back their money without them asking for it? I called the State of Tennessee
      and asked Daphne Smith, who was the commissioner, what do you know about this? I mean, if Morgan Stanley
      was taking it upon themselves to recognize a violation that they made in Tennessee, and they were going to
      correct the violation without you knowing it, I would say that would be one big breach of the relationship
      between the firm and your state.

    <p>Quite honestly, I couldn't get a legitimate answer from the state of Tennessee. And, by the way,
      Tennessee received over $274,000 for signing the consent agreement with Morgan Stanley in 2008. Therefore,
      that should correlate to over 1000 breaches of blue-sky violations. Neither Daphne nor Carmen Jones, nor
      the follow-on Commissioner when we pressed them to give us some answers, was forthright in addressing
      specifics.</p>

    <p>When I went back to the Wall Street Journal to tell them that their article had elicited the call from
      Ohio, which set this thing on a whole different level of pursuit, I actually thought that when I walked
      out of Morgan Stanley, this was all I could do. But when I found out about the activities in Tennessee, it
      was difficult to unengage. So, I asked Randall Smith to continue to cover the story with a nice letter
      saying I believed it's their responsibility because they caused these actions to happen to stay on it. And
      they wouldn't budge.
    <p>Now, when you have a story as big as this one, and your initial reporting was significant enough to bring
      information back that continued to move the story forward, and you don't want to do it, something caused
      that to happen. Now, I can speculate on this a little bit.
    <p>My impression is that they received a phone call from the legal department of Morgan Stanley, a day or
      two after this article came out, suggesting why in the world are you writing a story about Dana de Windt
      on an action that's already been covered and processed by FINRA? Not only that, the action took place
      approximately six months before you came out with this article. Morgan Stanley would have been incensed
      about seeing me coming around another corner when they and FINRA had processed an incompetent and
      virtually worthless order not addressing either the blue-sky violations nor the misrepresented KLSN
      violations.
    <p>And you as readers can decide what ramifications might have been insinuated by continuing to put me in a
      position where I'm moving the story forward. So that being the case, I elected to talk to a person at the
      New York Times. She was Gretchen Morgenson, who, incidentally, had been a former Dean Witter broker, a
      firm which Morgan Stanley purchased in the 1990’s. And I told her that the WSJ wasn’t going on it, and
      that I would provide her with all the information. I wrote her officially, but the New York Times and
      Gretchen decided that they would not move along on this either.</p>

  <!--The NASAA Meeting in DC-->
  <div class="Seventeen" id="Seventeen">
    <h1 class="Seventeenh1">The NASAA Meeting in DC</h1>
    <p>Although I didn't have full information at the time when I went to Washington, I met with the general
      counsel of the North American Securities Administrators Association to talk with him about my knowledge
      that Florida was not addressing the rescissions correctly simply based on the excessive overcharging on
      the “bond pricing”. We seemed to have a constructive conversation for about 40 minutes, and he said he'd
      look into it. His name is Rex Staples. Interesting to note that he was unwilling to schedule a meeting
      with me in his office, so I attended an offsite meeting with FINRA where I was able to engage him. He
      seemed interested but never mentioned their $8,500,000 consent order with the states even though it was
      out without informing the MS financial advisors.

    <p>So, I went home back to Florida and decided to search “Morgan Stanley'', the “NASAA”, which incidentally
      is the group of directors of the divisions of securities for the states and territories and “rescission”
      and out popped the first of many consent orders between Morgan Stanley and the states outlining the
      violations of the blue-sky laws, which I've mentioned earlier. As I am finishing this, The State of
      Missouri and Washington are still on the search. Look for yourself. I was also able to eventually find a
      prospectus on the KLSN's from 1996-97 which clearly pointed out that the security was a surplus note and
      not a bond. You’ll be able to read the language for yourself in the document below.

    <p>I will say that as a follow on to the Rex Staples conversation and my finding the consent agreement, I
      gave him a call. This was only a couple of days after I'd gotten back. I said, Rex, I certainly appreciate
      the time you spent with me the other day but when I got home, I did find this consent order, which is
      templated in a way that would seem to be an originating document from the NASAA. And I wondered, because
      you had not mentioned it, who's going to compel Morgan Stanley to comply with the orders found in the
      document?

    <p>His response to me, and you can see why this is easy to recall was, “you're charging me with
      malfeasance.” His other noteworthy comment to me even before I sat down with him for the meeting was so
      incredible that I am choosing to withhold it at this time. Maybe at a later date. I will say this: when a
      person chooses to withhold candor from you, they will say almost anything. It was very obvious that he
      knew who I was and the subject matter, and when I found the consent order, it threw him off.

    <p>When you read the order which I have highlighted, can you imagine that the violations in the order were
      never shared with the financial advisors, so they had no way of having the knowledge necessary to defend
      their clients? First, you were selling a surplus note disguised as a bond, and, next, you were involved
      with 8 years of blue-sky law violations. Rescission is the remedy, outlined in the consent order, but
      other than my leaning on Florida, there is no indication of other states providing the oversight they
      needed to, especially since many of them were receiving a portion of the $8,500,000 settlement. If you are
      one of the financial advisors caught in this, it’s a tough pill to swallow.

    <p>So, when I could elicit a reaction like that from Rex Staples, who I just met the other day, after a
      cordial conversation, I know this thing had an awful lot of depth to it. And that sent me moving again.


    <p>So, I once again took it upon myself to address everyone’s interest by attempting to meet with the SEC.
      Donna Norman agreed to assist and that email went out January 28, 2009. They finally agreed to meet with
      me in Washington on February 9.</p>

  <!--SEC and States-->
  <div class="Six" id="Six">
    <h1 class="Sixh1">SEC and States</h1>
    <p>I'm attaching a couple of things relative to the SEC, and the States. The mission of the United States
      Securities and Exchange Commission is to protect investors. The laws and rules that govern the securities
      industry in the United States derive from a simple and straightforward concept: all investors whether
      large institutions or private individuals should have access to certain basic facts about an investment
      prior to buying it. And so long as they hold it. To achieve this, the SEC requires public companies to
      disclose meaningful financial and other information to the public.
    <p>Certainly, in the case of lumbermen's, neither the financial advisors nor the investors themselves had
      any kind of a clear picture that this was a misrepresented security and something other than an actual
      bond. Also, it's so interesting to note that on February the eighth, 2008, right in the middle of
      everything that I was doing, the SEC, the NASAA and FINRA announced new steps to help protect senior
      investors. Well, why should you have to have new steps, you should always have had these steps. And I
      think you want to read what they say, because they're quoting the various people that run these agencies.
      And I find that it's words are not backed up with the actions they suggest.
    <p>Also, I'm showing you in the letter I wrote to every representative of every state and territory, what I
      had done with Florida, which I thought was all that had to be done. But I literally only heard back a
      response from one state only simply thanking me for informing them. Then there's an email that I sent to
      the General Counsel's Office of the states. And I think that what it says here is important. Because you
      probably need to hear a few of these things two or three times in different ways for you to get a real
      understanding because, after all, I've been doing this for years. And I can only give you a portion of
      what was accomplished during the time.
    <p>And finally, from the Freedom of Information Act, in the state of Florida, I got two major things. One is
      the email between Morgan Stanley and the state of Florida, which I've written some notes on, you know,
      they talk about the take up rate, and so forth and so on. Well, this just indicates clearer than ever,
      that the investors really had almost no chance of knowing what was going on. And because the State of
      Florida allowed Morgan Stanley to send rescission offers through regular mail, with a 30-day time frame on
      turning around the response. And this is seven years after the fact. You can imagine that some people who
      passed away moved into other facilities, maybe retirement homes, so forth, and so on.
    <p>What's telling about this email is that about the middle of the page, it was requested from Michael
      Banyas, that they send a copy of each offer of rescission sent to the client, and a copy of correspondence
      evidencing that payment was made to the client. The State of Florida allowed Morgan Stanley to send out
      rescission through regular mail, not certified as a receipt. Well, if you are allowed to send out your
      rescission offers through regular mail, you have no ability to certify that it ever went out in the first
      place, nor who may have received it, It would be my opinion, and I argued this with the State of Florida,
      that Morgan Stanley should have sent everyone with a certification of receipt, those receipts should have
      gone back to the State of Florida, and the State of Florida should have followed up with every single
      investor making sure that they had every chance of recovery.
    <p>The other thing that I received was the consent order saying that Morgan Stanley was going to go over
      millions of transactions and decide what was improperly registered for sale and offer rescissions on those
      sales. Well, I received 135 pages of those transactions that Morgan Stanley actually put together of
      unregistered sales. Cleverly, Morgan Stanley left off the Kemper Lumbermen’s Surplus Note sales to Florida
      investors of which, it comes to pass, that there were over 700 of them.
    <p>Of course, they're redacted as to investors, but it gave the security name and how much and so forth. No
      broker ever knew of these listed transactions nor of the blue-sky law violations. So, Morgan Stanley felt
      that it was important enough to identify all those transactions, which they said they would give
      rescissions to. In the case of the state of Florida 135 pages times about 40 a page comes up to over 5300+
      transactions. Now, Morgan Stanley paid the State of Florida over $1,230,000+, for signing the consent
      order. But I will tell you that there's no indication that the State of Florida ever provided any
      oversight with any of these rescissions.
    <p>If you take the logical route, and 5300 transaction violations of the blue-sky equaled $1,230,000 of the
      $8,500,000 that they paid, and you extrapolate it up, that's approximately 30,000 transactions across the
      United States. And the big point here is in those 135 pages, there was not one Kemper lumbermen surplus
      note mentioned, although I've told you, and I've showed you the document, that in the June 30, 2009
      quarterly, they paid $8.4 million, approximately, for the sale of the unregistered securities of Kemper
      lumbermen surplus notes to investors in the State of Florida. I found this on May 6, 2011 as was noted in
      the blog. Digging, digging, always looking for the slipup which linchpins the actions of Morgan Stanley
      and the State of Florida.
    <p>Now, obviously, the right hand didn't know what the left hand was reporting as I was told by Florida in
      email that the recovery was from the violation of Florida statute 517.061(17), a pricing infraction,
      because whoever put that in the quarterly, and thank goodness they did, provided us with the absolute
      linchpin that Morgan Stanley sold these as part of an unregistered securities sale, and that's why
      everyone in the United States should be receiving their rescission on Kemper lumbermens surplus notes
      without failure.
    <p>You might ask, well, what do you think the value of that is? If you add everything up, I suppose that
      there were probably 200 to 300 million dollars of the notes that were sold through the Morgan Stanley
      fixed income department from January of 2001 through the time that they went down to zero, which was
      sometime in 2003. The FINRA order identified over $59,000,000 from January 10, 2001 through mid June of
      that year. I certainly can’t be exact but when there are 2807 sales in that period, you know they were
      ferociously soliciting the advisors to move the surplus notes to their clients. And there's also an
      interest penalty component on rescission. The one in Florida was 7% annually. One in Tennessee was 10% a
      year. So, all told, I think a fair number is north of $500 million due back to clients. Most of them who
      didn't even know to this day that it wasn't a bond. It was a surplus note and unregistered for sale thus
      violating the Blue Sky laws of the United States.
    <p>And while I'm at it, I want to say this. To the best of my investigation, there was no purposeful
      wrongdoing by any of my financial advisor colleagues, but the culpability falls on upper management, the
      fixed income department and the legal department. Morgan Stanley misrepresented intentionally and
      deliberately the information you were given. And again, you did nothing wrong. And as every broker knows,
      the remedy for this violation is rescission.</p>

      <h1 class="Nineh1">Requested Advanced Email Search</h1>
      <p>Let me go on to another extraordinary set of events that was going on. Remember, I had one client that I
        took to arbitration in 2004. I only sold it to one client, it happened to be my father. I didn't purchase
        a great deal of the lumbermen's notes, but another related legal matter was going on at the same time. Ron
        Perlman had an action against Morgan Stanley, relative to his 82% interest in Coleman, being sold to
        Sunbeam, of which there was a failure of the transaction and he sued for recovery. During his case, which
        was adjudicated by now retired judge Elisabeth Maas in the Palm Beaches, the circumstance came about that
        Morgan Stanley was not forthcoming in discovery through emails and they actually suggested that they lost
        their emails in 9/11. Because of the arbitration I had, as a continuing action under FINRA, with my
        father, I was entitled to request an advanced email search. And I did.
      <p>And I'm going to show you the search terms and the attorney for Morgan Stanley's remarks on trying to get
        it dismissed, and show my consequential objections to his objecting You know, this was a really simple
        thing I, I asked for the names of Zoe Cruz, who was running the fixed income department at the time of the
        lumbermen's sales, Kenneth Carberry who was fined and suspended out of Morgan Stanley by the FINRA order
        of August 2, 2007. And Josh Zucker, who was one of the active NY traders soliciting brokers to sell the
        lumbermen's notes.
      <p>Morgan Stanley objected to my being allowed to have this advanced email search. Obviously when they
        looked at the search terms and put them in the email search for a glimpse at the results for their eyes
        only, they must not have liked what they saw. Because they didn't choose to have an in-house attorney
        attempt to handle me, they went outside to a Park Avenue attorney, his name was Daniel J. Toal. I have
        included his resume as well and his comments to Bradley Skolnick, who is the administrator of the action.
        Toal is no average choice. Let’s say this issue has been elevated into the big leagues.
      <p>The bottom line is that in spite of Morgan Stanley's frantic efforts to keep me from having an advanced
        email search, I prevailed. Mr. Skolnick favored my receiving the email search. Morgan Stanley has refused
        to do a lawful search and provided me with literally nothing. They still owe me the search.I look forward
        to receiving the email search because I thought that it would bring to light a number of things that we as
        financial advisors didn't know about the Kemper Lumbermens surplus notes, and what was going back and
        forth between legal and fixed income and so forth. Well, this was back in approximately November of 2008.
        As far as I know, they still must produce the legal search.
      <p>And I want to tell you this, that I am still waiting for the email search to come my way . Obviously,
        Morgan Stanley decided that they would stonewall the search, and let me try to take additional legal
        action to get the search accomplished. Well, you know, that's fine and dandy for somebody with unlimited
        resources going up against the firm like this. I went back to Bradley Skolnick and said that this
        non-compliant behavior is just about what I would expect from Morgan Stanley, and I'd appreciate him
        stepping in and forcing them to comply with his orders and nothing came of it. So as far as what I'm
        saying to you today, I still look forward to receiving the email search if this action continues, and
        certainly I'm counting on some public outcry of Morgan Stanley's unwillingness to go along with the actual
        legal consequences, which they and I have been at since 2003.
      <p>I am informing of this because it’s just another indication of the lengths Morgan Stanley has gone to
        thwart my determination to get investors whole.</p>

    <h1 class="Fourh1">Time to man up for Mike Blankenship</h1>
    <p>I also decided that I would be an expert witness in another arbitration in 2006 before the FINRA order of
      August 2, 2007 came out: that of Morgan Stanley against Mike Blankenship trying to recover the value of
      his promissory note value because he was thrown out of the office before the promissory note had been
      fully matured, which was after 4 years. As a co-manager of 7 E F Hutton offices formerly, I saw how Morgan
      Stanley chose to throw Mike out after he faced off with the legal department of Lumbermens. The grounds
      which were used to extricate Mike from their employment were not related to Lumbermens and were not
      sufficient for firing him. I know all about the infraction, and it was worthy simply of a note to his
      file.

    <p>I want to tell you that I was still employed with Morgan Stanley, and I went down as an expert witness to
      testify in arbitration. Morgan Stanley lost in the arbitration and received no recovery. I think the point
      I want to make here is you can tell that something very profound was going on here, within the boundaries
      of this whole matter because I remained working for Morgan Stanley for over five years, while engaging
      openly in attempts to overturn the ramifications of the lumbermen's surplus notes, and they elected that
      they would just keep me in place. It was told to me that this was the first case won by the financial
      advisor who didn’t have to pay the promissory note back. It wasn’t particularly easy for me to face off
      with my employer in the session, but prevailing for Mike was very satisfying.</p>

      <h1 class="Tenh1">Another Valued Whistle Blower Story</h1>
      <p>Harry is credited with a concentrated effort in bringing to light the Madoff matter. With all of Harry’s
        skills, he had one heck of a time bringing the Madoff scheme full circle.
      <p>You may have missed some of the activity surrounding the Bernie Madoff matter which occurred earlier this
        century when my dispute also began. But I wanted you to read this story about Harry Markopoulos testifying
        in front of the House Financial Services Committee. He spent an awful long time trying to get the right
        attention on what he knew, and rightfully so, was a major Ponzi scheme of immense proportions.
      <p>Harry is well recognized for his outstanding skills in forensic accounting. I, on the other hand,
        developed my skills by co managing 7 EF Hutton offices and becoming a FINRA arbitrator able to evaluate
        facts in disputes between financial firms and investors. He earned his reputation, and I’m quite sure I
        earned mine.
      <p>I think what you take from this is, even in the situations where facts seem so obvious and easy to pick
        up, unless everyone is pulling in the same direction, much of the information gets disjointed and loses
        focus. Take a moment to read this story and realize that a whistleblower does have quite a mountain to
        climb to get results. It takes a dose of courage as well as stamina to hold the line. I believe that my
        dispute also ought to be heard as well, in front of the House Financial Services Committee.</p>

  <!--Closing comments and observations-->
  <div class="Seven" id="Seven">
    <h1 class="Sevenh1">Closing comments and observations</h1>
    <p>Last year, the SEC decided to issue a record $114 million award to an individual who they say is to
      remain anonymous, which means several things. I am, in fact, also a Whistleblower who chose not to be
      anonymous as declared in the WSJ article complete with a whistle in my mouth and caption “Dana de Windt
      blew the whistle.”.There's no indication of what the violations were that this individual submitted to the
      SEC, nor the company or individual who did the violations.
    <p>Frankly, I believe if the SEC discharged their oversight in this case, there would be a massive award
      which would be aimed for the benefit of the powerless and properly funded by the powerful. I call it the
      1% rule. All of the portion of an award directed toward me would be headed in the right direction with
      none benefitting me. I am pleased to let you know that.
    <p>So, in my case, I started this with the SEC back in November of 2004, and worked very hard through late
      2008-2009. And then, throughout the rest of the next decade, trying to get them to wake up to the reality
      that it's their responsibility to step in for the investors, resolve the problem of non-performance of the
      rescissions and move forward.
    <p>As a former industry arbitrator with FINRA, and branch manager with EF Hutton, for multiple offices, my
      responsibility, and really all of our responsibilities for that matter, in our industry is to oversee the
      activities of our company and be sure that nobody is taken advantage of or breaching fiduciary
      responsibility to each other, and certainly not to investors.
    <p>When I saw the record whistleblower award, it occurred to me that this was another chance to write a
      letter to the head of the whistleblower department, and she certainly knows who I am. We requested Jane
      Norberg reengage, as this matter has not concluded, and we'd like an invitation to meet with the SEC. They
      cannot simply say it’s a states matter when the states are derelict in this matter.
    <p>But I'd like to say this, I've tried to adequately represent the interests of the financial advisors, who
      sold Kemper lumbermen's surplus notes without knowledge of the deliberate and intentional
      misrepresentation of them not being bonds and also not properly registered for sale to investors. But
      also, many brokers may have been involved in the sale of the other portion of the unregistered securities,
      of which I mentioned previously, that could be a figure of over 30,000 transactions. If you, as a broker,
      were doing business at Morgan Stanley from 1997 to 2005, you never had an office meeting about the consent
      order that went out identifying the breach of blue-sky laws for that period of time.</p>

    <h1 class="Eighth1">Thoughts on this story/essay from here</h1>
    <p>Although this essay is lengthy, everything you have read above is essential to understanding Morgan
      Stanley’s and their regulator’s moves and behavior from 18-20 years ago. My effort was to prod and search
      for the many missing details which could shed light on the subject and eventually have a clear picture to
      show you.
    <p>Below, are several topics you’ll see are also part of the story. This is the time to bring out the
      Rescorla connection for the first time because my interests are clearly opposite Morgan Stanley’s. It’s
      time you heard about the advanced email search and other motivating factors which helped drive my pursuit
      to the right conclusion. Once again, I will say this. Morgan Stanley, you have been caught by your own
      signed documents violating the laws specific to protecting your employees and their clients. You could
      have addressed this back when I and others alerted you, but you chose to cloak the information and play
      defense for years. FINRA, the members of the NASAA and the SEC have made decisions for which there can be
      no logical explanation. I am sorry that I have spent nearly 25% of my life chasing you all around.
    <p>I don’t actually know the ramifications of informing through this medium, but if you thought that I was
      going to let my former colleagues stay in the dark after you threw them collectively under the bus, well
      maybe you underestimated. Let the chips fall where they may.</p>

    <p>During the time that I was waiting for FINRA to reveal their examination findings, I decided that in July
      of 2006, which was coming up on the fifth-year anniversary of 9/11, there was something that I could do
      relative to that anniversary. So I decided to reach out to Rick Rescorla's widow, Susan. Rick was the
      director of security at Morgan Stanley and was credited, as you may know, with saving 2700 plus lives of
      Morgan Stanley employees because of his actions. And I thought on a fifth-year anniversary, maybe there
      was something that Susan would be thinking about that I might address. I did find her number, and she was
      nice enough to take my call, and I introduced myself.
    <p>And much to my surprise she said there's a problem. At this point she wanted to send me a video of Rick's
      statue dedication at Fort Benning, which was done in April of 2006. And then I want to tell you that
      there's been a disjoint relationship with Morgan Stanley, relative to the foundation. And we have a
      shortfall in being able to provide the granite base, which would hold the statue on the Memorial Walk of
      Honor at Fort Benning, which later was placed in 2009.
    <p>Susan sent down the video, and a recording of Rick's favorite songs. And I looked at it and the video was
      at the dedication of the statue attended by both of the other trustees Dan Hill and Fred McBee along with
      Susan, with the Fort Benning soldiers, and members of Rolling Thunder. You may want to see this ceremony
      on youtube. And, of course, the artist and General Moore who you might remember was portrayed in the movie
      We Were Soldiers, when Rick was the platoon leader for platoon B in that particular fight in la Drang
      Vietnam.
    <p>Anyway, I looked at all of this and so forth, and she mentioned the figure that they were short of funds
      on providing the granite base. Apparently a commitment had been made by Morgan Stanley and had not been
      fully honored. I decided, in view of the fact that I purchased an older vintage car in 2004, a bit of
      muscle in my engagement with Morgan Stanley, and we're now in 2006, that the end of the FINRA examination
      would end my participation. I opted to dedicate the car and send it to them so that they could sell it and
      have enough funds for the base of the statue. I wanted to show you the pictures of the car. The young man
      on the hood of the car was a little less than three in the picture. And he is now nearly 18. A lot of time
      has gone by.
    <p>There is more to this story, but it doesn’t need to be discussed in this context. I did mention to Susan
      that in the video there were no representatives of Morgan Stanley talking at the dedication. And she came
      back with the fact that none of them were invited for the April 2006 event. And then in 2009 before the
      placement of the statue at Fort Benning which I did attend, I did send her an email asking if this would
      be a time to let go of those feelings and offer a participation by Morgan Stanley with their appreciation
      for Rick's sacrifice.
    <p>My email to her should reflect that my personal dispute with Morgan Stanley was totally separate from the
      Rescorla Foundation issues. I am including my email suggestion to her and her response. I want you to know
      that Susan did respond 4 minutes later. I think that you should know that I wanted to support the
      Rescorla's as the statue was being placed beautifully at the Ft. Benning Infantry Museum on the Memorial
      Walk of Honor. He deserves so much appreciation and none of those saved by Rick apparently were in
      attendance to honor his efforts. A sad part of his amazing legacy. I am very happy that I chose to attend
      the event and participated in the foundation’s financial needs with Susan and Rick’s children Treavor and
      Kim.
    <p>Take a few minutes and watch the 2 videos I have placed on the page. You’ll be able to share in some very
      special comments. As, honestly, I thought that my battle with Morgan Stanley and the regulators was coming
      to an end, a fitting gesture to Rick and the many lives he saved was to offer my symbol of my fight with
      Morgan Stanley to the Foundation. But, of course, along came the WSJ article in May of 2008, and I wasn’t
      about to walk away from the information which eventually and vividly showed the violations. Think of it
      this way: if you had information which could assist others, would you walk away or continue to face the
      opponents and obstacles ahead?</p>

    <p>J. Adams, Del de Windt, Dana de Windt, J.Q. Adams</p>
    <p>There is part of my lineage which is special and which I identify with very closely, being the family
      historian. I have a family tree, which was completed back in the early 1900s, which reaches back into the
      1600s. And my seventh- generation grandfather ended up being John Adams, and consequently, my sixth-
      generation uncle is the man I more easily identify with, John Quincy Adams. As I have done throughout the
      last 18 years, I took time to visit Braintree Massachusetts, where both men are interred at the United
      First Parish Church. I took time to stand next to John and Abigail Adams and John Quincy and Louisa to
      share my thoughts about this in hopes that maybe the proximity to their spirit would again boost me to
      move everything in the right direction. So, I thought I would share with you an important clip from the
      movie Amistad which will give you a glimpse at John Quincy, and then I'll tell you why I think we're alike
      and how this plays into the final chapter of this ordeal. Please now sit back and enjoy the 7-minute clip
      of a man who meets a tough challenge and resolves the Amistad matter in 1841. I like men who stand strong
      when the powerless are at risk. Take time to view the video now.</p>

    <div class="iframe-container">
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/86yzWmrR3Hk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></iframe>
   </div>   
   
    <p>I believe that is an honest and true depiction of my uncle. And I certainly have enjoyed seeing how he
      was portrayed in the movie. You know, he didn't choose to volunteer as counsel in the Amistad matter. He
      was solicited. I certainly didn't choose and solicit my way into an 18-year fray with Morgan Stanley and
      their regulators, it just kept going. When the situation dictated that there needed to be another opening,
      it appeared and, of course, I was the only one around to try to recognize it. In the clip, he got annoyed
      periodically. And certainly, so have I during these many years. His case was significant, and so is this.
      He suggests that it's who tells the best story wins. I have endeavored to do this. Such an important
      comparison is the value of invoking one’s ancestors for their inspiration and guidance when a situation
      seems dire.

    <p>Clearly, I have used that as Cinque did. I visited the United First Parish Church in Quincy, Mass.
      several times. When Morgan Stanley took me on, they took on the strength of my family. I am proud to have
      taken on this challenge and will always remember “who we are is who we were.”

    <p>I reached out to the outstanding illustrator, Charlie Powell, who was responsible for the illustration of
      me in the WSJ article of May 24, 2008. I asked for his permission to use the illustration and he willingly
      said yes. And then it occurred to me that if I am letting you understand how valuable my ancestral
      connections are, that he would paint a second illustration of four key members of The Committee, with whom
      I sought direction and support. Thank you, Charlie, for depicting the members accurately and warmly as I
      continued to lean forward against Morgan Stanley and their regulators.

    <p>Morgan Stanley needs to step forward as others have in their lives, like John Quincy and Rick have done
      to tackle difficult situations. Be brave and courageous and meet your responsibility. That's all I have to
      say.</p>

    <h1 class="Thirteenh1">Where's the driving force?</h1>
    <p>I believe that I would like to conclude this story with a thought or two about the necessary
      responsibilities we all have to work together to identify a wrong and stand up strong to make it right. I
      have offered some difficult information for you to swallow in my effort to bring you on board in
      understanding the intentional decisions made by many to violate others.

    <p>Coincidentally, two actions took place in 1829 that are interesting to reflect on. The first was the
      final year of John Quincy Adams presidency and the second took place with a composition in four parts,
      each following without a pause. Why do I say without a pause? It’s because I can say without hesitation
      that for over 18 years, and the ramifications of that lengthy time, this matter has been a “constant
      companion” both day and night trying to get those who should assist to assist, and I can say that I have
      not paused either..
    <p>The second action occurred when Gioachino Rossini wrote an overture not knowing that it would evolve into
      an anthem expressing a feeling, for many of us, of optimism, right over wrong and a feeling of
      exhilaration. You will see that it takes perfection, coordination and zeal to get this absolutely right,
      allowing the listener to feel elated at the crescendo. I have tried to get this right as well.
    <p>So, I offer you a few moments to listen to and understand that the William Tell Overture is my way of
      letting you know that it was my turn to step up and help solve the mystery behind the deliberate
      wrongdoings of Kemper Lumbermens Surplus Notes. So, sit back, turn up the volume, put a smile on your face
      and stand with the crescendo!!!! This is for my special inspiration from both John Quincy and Rick
      Rescorla with thanks.</p>

    <h1 class="Fifteenh1">6 Songs</h1>
    Motivation for staying the course can come from lots of sources.
    I thought I’d share with you several songs I've listened to while trudging forward was tough at times.
    I've included all six songs, some of them you probably have never heard before. Some are from my
    mid-teens. And each of them played a part in maintaining my balance in the face of some of the stress that
    I've gone through over the years trying to move forward. So, here's how I feel about the six.
    During my ordeal with Morgan Stanley and the regulators, the negative sets in frequently. And you ask
    yourself “why try”. which brings you to wonder if you should “forget it all”. Often, I needed during the
    lonely months and years ahead to have others stand down and “Please” don't say nothing at all. How many
    restless nights were fraught with “pulsating dreams” of power-driven men and women masterminding the steps
    to suppress the truth about these “bringers of darkness?” Then along came the special lyrics of “life
    uncommon”, reminding me many times that indeed, “we are tired, we are weary, but we aren’t worn out.” And
    finally, in a March 18, 2018 concert in the third row at the Sunrise Theatre in Fort Pierce, I saw a man
    who I've had a high regard and respect for a long time, John Kay and his band Steppenwolf. I heard him
    tell all of us to “hold on” , never give up, never give in, and this allowed me to relax for the last
    three years and “feed the fire”.</p>
